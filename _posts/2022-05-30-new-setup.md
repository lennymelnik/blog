I have been trying to perfect my setup for quite some time. And its actually a running joke in my family that I have to reorganize before completing any task.

At one point I actually got close to my dream setup. I had an M1 Macbook air, 4k monitor, amazing speakers. But, surpisingly, every now and again the Macbook would just crash. It became very frustrating and the issue apparently had been happening to others too. Including my friends.

Fast foward a year, I fell in love with Thinkpads, specifically the X220 line. Obviously running Pop-OS. it works for a really long time, but the screen was bugging me. I'm pretty sure they had TN panels and the resolution was simply not there. I was able to get my work done using workspaces, but I could feel the strain on my eyes. Another thing that became an issue was my neck. I would have to bend it down to be able to look at the screen, and that resulted in headaches.

As I got more into vintage computers, I liked using them so much that I wanted to migrate some of my tasks to them. They were just so fun to use
