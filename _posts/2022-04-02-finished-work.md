Thats a super good question. I am currently in that state.

I worked so hard that I finished everything I needed to get done for the next two weeks.

Sure, I could do more stuff past that. But that sounds like work I should not do since I already did so much.

Now I actually just solved the issue. Because I have so many "projects" and things to do. I just chose one and started working. Normally this is hard to do. But I have different working environments for different types of work. One computer for school and education related work (Macbook), and then my 70$ think-pad for coding in a separate room.

No matter how much you do, there will always be more to tick off your to do list. There is ALWAYS something. This can lead you to feeling like you are accomplishing nothing since there is always more to do.

One way I try to combat this is by writing down all the accomplishments I have each day. It could range from doing laundry and eating properly to building the platform I have been dreaming of for months.

Also, sometimes a break is needed. If you can no longer work with your brain. Do something that involves more physical requirements. Or just relax.
