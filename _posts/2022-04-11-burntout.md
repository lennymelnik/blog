I feel super pooped. Like beyond pooped.

I got a lot of cool stuff done today and figured out how I can use Next.js to really take my apps to the next level.

But its just one of those days. I think I burnt out again. Which is fine, shit happens.

Its really easy to get so sucked into the routine that things slowly start going downwards. And you don't realize until its at a critial point.

Although something that does make me happy is how this blog can parse HTML and

```
Markdown
```

Slowly I can build my mood back up, and do what I need to do while enjoying it.

I think burning out is a part of life. And its a cycle of reaching your limits with the current processes you have in mind.

So just like every other time, I will revaluate some of the processes I have. See what does work, and sudo kill -9 the services that dont.

This time I think I will take more time to appreciate my accomplishments. I have been doing really well recently and got too normalize to it. To the point that the AMAZING things were "ok" but the bad things would absolutly ruin me.

I don't know if I will go back to my extreme schedule of waking up super early. But I think I will try it just incase.
