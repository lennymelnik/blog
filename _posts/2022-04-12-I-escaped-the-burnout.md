This is the morning after. I still feel a little off, but in general I feel amazing.

Yea It sucks because I need to run right now to school and don't finish classes till 7pm (still have to head home on the shitty MTA).

However, I feel rejuvinated.

Yesterday I took the time to evaluate my prorities, as well as clean up. Like a lot.

Usually my physical space is a reflection of my mental state, and wow it was cluttered.

So I cleaned all that up, and will continue cleaning today once I return.

Also I ordered some post it notes. Because I had the idea to write down my accomplishmenets each day on them. And then stick them up on the wall.

I am really excited to start working again.

Off to school now ->>>
