So my girlfriend and I slept in a bit. Then we rushed out to make it to classes on time.


The train wasn't arriving, and I check and there were delays on basically every line heading to Manhattan (from Brooklyn).

I took a screenshot and sent it to my professor "Hello professor, there are massive delays so I will be late for class". He responded with,
> Oh, the shooting is affecting you too?

Then not a second after I got texts from friends checking in to make sure I was ok. What the fuck happened??

Checking the news I saw the horror. It's like my biggest fear, and this might push me over the edge of not taking the MTA.

There is still limited news going around right now, but the perpetrator has not been found.

I messaged the rest of my friends, still waiting to hear back from some of them.

Even though this feels much less that it should, considering I hear news of shooting almost every day. But its starting to get to me more.

How much are we putting ourselves at risk every day? And is it worth it?
