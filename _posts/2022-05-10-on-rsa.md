This is going to be a breakdown/understanding of how RSA encryption works.

Technically this should be in the DEV category of this blog, but since it deals with "vintage" software I guess I will put it here

First, when encrypting a string. Since we cannot perform arithmetic operations on letters, we will convert it to numbers in a certain way.

Lets start with the string "Hello World". Lets say we somehow convert it into the number 213213123213.


We need to pick numbers p and q. They need to be prime numbers.

p times q is the modulus, then we make a list of every number between 1 and the modulus

so if p = 3 q =7

modulus = 3 * 7 = 21

our list:
<ul class='list-desc'>

{% for i in (1..21) %}

  <li>  {{ i }}</li>
{% endfor %}


</ul>

Then we need to take every number that does not have a common factor with our modulus (21)
<ul class='list-desc'>
<li> 2</li>
<li> 4</li>
<li> 5</li>
<li> 8</li>
<li> 10</li>
<li> 11</li>
<li> 13</li>
<li> 16</li>
<li> 17</li>
<li> 19</li>
<li> 20</li>
</ul>

The length of this second list is now our variable L (11 in this case)

So the variable we have:
P = 3
Q = 7
Modulus = 21
L = 11

For the encryption key, we need to find a number between 1 and L (so between 1 and 12) that is a coprime with L and the Modulus.

A coprime is a number that has no other common factors with each other than 1.

The only number that satisfys that is 5.

So we encrypt with the keys 5,21(our modulus)


now lets actually use these keys to encrypt
