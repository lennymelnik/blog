As I check my watch, its 1:24am.
<br /> 
Have I been up the whole time? No, ive been in bed since 10. And that is the most frustrating part.

In order to be able to sleep I need to be tired, in order to be tired I need to wake up early. In order to wake up early I need to go to sleep early.

The hard part is that first night, and I really wanted it to be tonight. Who knows, it still might be, but I am not excited for the day to come.

Last night I had to stay up till 2am, working on a term project tirelessly. Whats my excuse today?

Honestly, nothing. I just need to fix my schedule and a few other things.

Like I would like to get back to working out, because nothing helps me sleep better like physical exhaustion.

Something I wanted to mention that is frustrating me quite a bit are my teeth. I am 19, and just had some cavities filled. Yet today as I was drinking (cold) water, I had this unbelievable pain in the tooth that my dentist supposidly fixed. SO that sucks

Its not all bad though. I have been understanding myself more and am very happy about it. I also have been learning more and more about computer architecture.

Let me actually talk about this in another post
