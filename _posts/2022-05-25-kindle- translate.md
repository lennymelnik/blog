Just to start, I love Kindles. I have one myself, and reccomend them to a lot of people.

Loading books and documents is super easy. For me, not for my grandfather. Who also has a kindle.

Regardless of the fact that he is generally very competent at using technology. When it comes to the different type of kindle book formats. He is hopeless.

I tried teaching him how to use the software to convert certain files to mobi using calibre, but it sometimes gets too complicated.

Instead I decided I would simply use a Rasberry Pi. That he would plug the kindle into, it would then scan the kindle filesystem for any non-mobi files, and convert them automaticaly using the calibre.

Now I could do this via a simple script. But I don't want it to rely on his computer or any action.

Here are the requirements

- No buttons

- Autodetect when kindle has been attached

- Maybe somekind of progress indicator??
