I am so happy. The director of a cybersecurity/psychology lab got back to me today and invited me to join!!
Even though I think it is not a paid thing, I am so happy to be a part of it and finally contribute.

I was honestly starting to worry that I would never be given the opportunity to apply myself.

I have been doing research and going over all the resources to see what sort of research I will be conducting. And it is exactly what I wanted to be doing!

Although, most of the data collection seems to be manually done. I think I should be able to find a good way to automate it. I just need to figure out exactly what I will be automating and how.
For example I could make a bot that gets all the relevant news for me, and then displays it for me to go to. And something that catalogs everything I have already gone over?

I do wish to write about my approaches to the research. But for now I need to plan things out!
