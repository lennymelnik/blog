My productivity, or relative productivity is a big and very important part of how I feel.
<br/>

This is not because I put a lot of pressure on myself, or I have an unhealthy need to be constantly productive.
<br/>
Instead, working and accomplishing my goals makes me happy. So I seek to set out goals for each day.
<br/>
They range from simple things like doing to laundry, to more complex things such as a large amount of software development.
<br/>
There are two things I need to watch out for.

<br/>
   
 <ul class='list-decimal'>
        <li>Burning out (too much work)</li>
        <li>Exhaustion (too tired to work)</li>
    </ul>

<br/>

If I work too much and push too far, then I burn out. Burn out then leads to exhaustion (either from staying up late to catch up on work, or just being sleepy). Then when I am exhausted I cannot wake up on time the next morning and have the energy to get my my work done.

<br/>


```js

console.log("Hello")

```
<a class='text-2xl'>Progress</a>

<ul class='list-desc'>
        <li>05/01/22 @ 6:20 am - It was really hard to initially get out of bed, but once I made it then I had no issue. I do need to figure out and get some snacks for the morning, as while working I get the munchies.</li>


</ul>
