My first venture into Vintage computers was primarily revolved around IBM machines. Since it was the first one I bought, I kind of anchored to it. Nothing else seemed to interest me at the time.

Then all of a sudden, on Hacker News. There was this article about the team behind MOS, and how they developed the Commodore 64 as well as the VIC-20 before it.

I was absolutely hooked because of the open nature of it. These systems could be tinkered with, like with the KIM.

My research continued by watching a documentary about Jack Tramel. Which was interesting, but I wanted to hear more from the engineers.

Based on the videos I was watching, I saw that people could get their hands on some commodores for 20 bucks or less. But as soon as I hit the online market, prices STARTED at 100$. And those were non-working models.
