Something I have written about a lot is how starting is the hardest part of anything for me. I have no issue working once I do begin, but its almost as if I prevent myself from starting.

What am I afraid of? Failure?

I honestly don't know. I think before I begin something I have no idea where I will go with it, and that is sometimes intimidating for me.

This has not posed an issue for me, as I have always been able to get everything done and well. But its time for a change.

I hate being stressed, and even if procrastinating sometimes works, it stresses me out.

I got the lowest grade in my college career today, a 77. Although it won't affect my GPA, and I have done decent in the class otherwise. It feels like a major blow to myself.

Why didn't I do better? Well first off, I think my work was pretty good. Sure it had its issues, but surely it did not merit a 76. Thats beyond what I care about though. I should have given myself more time, and should have had some peers review my work.

I have class in 25 minutes. Until then I will be working on a project that should help me in this field. Its something I call 10atask.

Basically it will choose what I work on for me. I get so much done and have so much time left over. Like way too much, maybe this will help me with the starting issue. Decision fatigue is a bitch.
